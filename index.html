        <p>Once upon a time in a land of magic and make believe
            there lived a boy named Theo.  He was an ordinary boy
            with no magical powers and to be truthful there was
            nothing exceptionally extraordinary about him at all.
        </p>
        <p>Theo lived in the tiny village of Odg.  Odg was a farming village
            with large pastures of green grass and many animals.  There was
            one large farmhouse and one large barn that belonged to farmer Aguirre.
            Often times at dusk Theo would sneak into farmer Aguirre's barn to sleep.
            You see young Theo was an orphan.  And as orphan's have no parents to
            take care of them Theo had learned to live on his own with the help of
            strangers.  Many of the strangers did not realize they were helping Theo
            but that's neither here nor there.</p>

        <img src="images/Russian-Village-136.jpg" alt="Small Village">
        <p>One day in the center of town farmer Aguirre came into town with several
            other men from the village.  All of them appeared to be walking beside a
            great beast of some kind.  But it was impossible to tell what kind of beast
            it was because a great sheet of cloth was covering the head and body of the
            beast.  The gargantuan nature of the beast was apparent for the beast was snorting
            and snuffing and huffing and puffing.  Young Theo was quite curious about
            this beast and wondered what it could possibly be that lay under the cloth
            that covered it.  </p>
        <p>That night Theo snuck into Farmer Aguirre's barn to sleep.  He thought he might
            catch a peak at the beast but it was not there.  Theo was just about to make
            his bed for the night when something in the distance caught his eye.  He squinted
            his eyes and peered deep into the darkness of the night across the great rolling
            fields.  Was it a light of some sort?  It was indeed!  A fire was flickering in
            the distance, Theo was sure of it.  He immediately got up and started moving toward
            the fire.  He made sure to keep silent and stealthy so that no one would notice
            him approaching.  </p>
        <p>As he got closer Theo was beginning to make out a figure that seemed to be a horse.
            It was most certainly the most enornous, gargantuan horse that young Theo had ever
            seen.  He could see the men from the village struggling with the horse with ropes and
            whips.  The men did not appear to be able to contain the great beast.  As Theo neared the
            camp he was struck with fear.  Had he just seen what he thought he had seen?  He stopped
            dead in his tracks.  It couldn't be so.  It wasn't possible.  This was no ordinary horse.
            Theo looked again and this time he was sure; the horse, the most fantastically hunormous
            beast of a horse he had ever laid eyes on was not a horse at all.  It was some sort of mythical
            creature:<h2 id="special">A HORSE WITH FOUR HEADS!</h2></p>
